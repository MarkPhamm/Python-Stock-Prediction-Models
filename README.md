# COMING SOON 
# Python Stock Prediction Models

This project demonstrates various stock prediction models using Python. The project covers topics including exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive charting, moving averages (MA), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential moving average (EMA), golden cross strategies, and long short-term memory (LSTM) models.

## Overview

The project aims to provide insights into different approaches for predicting stock prices using popular techniques and models. It aims to enable users to understand and implement these techniques in their own stock market analysis and prediction projects.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA is a crucial step in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships in stock market data. This project provides examples of how to effectively perform EDA for stock market datasets.

- **Interactive Charting:** The project includes interactive charting tools to visualize stock price trends and patterns over time, allowing users to identify important trends and make informed decisions.

- **Moving Averages (MA):** Moving averages are widely used in technical analysis to analyze historical data and identify trends more effectively. This project demonstrates the implementation of various moving average strategies in stock price analysis.

- **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA):** ARIMA is a popular statistical method for time series analysis and forecasting future stock prices. This project includes examples and implementations of ARIMA models for stock price prediction.

- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** EMA is a type of moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The project showcases the use of EMA for smoothing out price data and emphasizing the latest trends.

- **Golden Cross Strategies:** Golden cross strategies are used in technical analysis to identify potential buy and sell signals in stock trading. This project demonstrates the application of golden cross strategies in stock market analysis.

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Models:** LSTM models are a type of recurrent neural network often used for processing and analyzing sequences of data. The project includes implementations of LSTM models for building deep learning-based predictive models for stock price prediction.
